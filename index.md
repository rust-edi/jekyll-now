## The meetups
We are a community of developers interested in the **Rust** programming lanuage, so
join us to get to know the local Rust development scene and attend some great
talks! **Everyone is welcome**, whether you are a new to Rust or you are a seasoned
developer.  
Please also take a look at our Code of Conduct.

You can find out more about our meetups on our
[Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/rust-edi) page.

### Your talk
We encourage anyone who has worked on or found out something cool about Rust to
give a talk at our meetups. If that sounds like you, get in touch with
us and we will sort it out! We accept talks from people of all skill levels, so
this is a great opportunity to get experience in speaking to audiences and
get feedback on your projects.

Get in touch with us via our social media accounts and drop us and email
if you have any questions or suggestions.
